# maze_solver

To run maze solver on a valid maze image (rectangular and axis aligned), you will need:

1. maze_solver.py (duh...)
2. Maze.py (duh...)
3. The Python Imaging Library (PIL) installed*

*Note: PIL has been discontinued but Pillow, but you can use Pillow, the friendly PIL fork (https://python-pillow.github.io/) instead

To run the maze solver, type following in command line
```
py maze_solver.py your_maze_image.png
```

Several maze images to try it on...
